# Identicon

Program that generates github-esque icon based on a string.

## Requirements
You will need to install and set up [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Usage

### Input

**in the iex, in the project directory**

```bash
iex > Identicon.main("John")
:ok
```

### Output

Hopefully the program will have generated a 250x250 image titled "John.png" in the root of the projects directory.

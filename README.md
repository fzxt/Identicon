# Identicon

Program that generates github-esque icon based on a string.

## Usage

### Input

**in the iex, in the project directory**

```bash
iex > Identicon.main("John")
:ok
```

### Output

Hopefully the program will have generated a 250x250 image titled "Johh.png" in the root of the projects directory.
